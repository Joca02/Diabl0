# About 
This is a single-level game made in Unity 3D where player's task is to defeat the dragon which represents the level's boss. To reach the dragon, the player first needs to destroy all zombie monsters that are scattered on the map. 
Until all of the zombies are destroyed, a big wall will prevent the player from entering part of the map that contains the dragon. Zombies and dragon use simple AI with which they start chasing the player after he gets near and when they catch up to the player, the attack is performed by them.
The player moves with right mouse click and has 3 abilities. 
- **Q**- Player starts spinning his sword, damaging all enemies around him
- **W**- Player heals himself for a certain amount of seconds
- **E**- Movement speed boost

  **Note:** After executing, each ability has its own cooldown, whose timer will be shown in the ability icon fill ratio. Meaning, that when the ability is executing, the image representing the ability won't be visible. When cooldown starts after execution, the image will start filling
itself gradually and when the image is filled entirely, the ability is available for usage again.

Player also has the ability to roll forward by pressing Left-Ctrl.
The game can be paused at any time by pressing the Esc button. It also contains several audio sources, including background music.
In case of the player's death, the level has to be started all over again, from the spawn point and monsters are regenerated.
